HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building
fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

This project is my base portfolio site. I initially used a HTML5 Boilerplate for the bare skeleton. It does not impose a specific development
philosophy. I did incorporate tools and tech such as particles.JS, Grunt, Animate.CSS, WOW.JS, node.JS, NPM and some others.
